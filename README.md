# Custom Topology Testing Framework

A demonstration of building custom topology validation tools for complex geospatial data relationships. While traditional GIS tools offer built-in topology checks, modern spatial data often requires more nuanced, domain-specific validation rules.

This framework shows how to implement attribute-aware topology testing through configurable rules in JSON format. It validates not just geometric correctness, but also domain-specific spatial relationships based on feature attributes and business rules. The included GUI makes it accessible for both technical and non-technical users.

Example use cases include validating road intersections based on infrastructure type (bridges/tunnels) or ensuring building relationships comply with specific zoning regulations.
